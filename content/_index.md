The title of the 9th edition of the European Conference, the first in presence after the pandemic, is «Frontline Europe: a continent's struggle for relevance, unity and value». Without a doubt, Russia's brutal invasion and its war on Ukraine marks a historic turning point. As a result, Europe's self-conception, as well as its role as both a regional and a global power have been lastingly impacted. The three major themes of the Conference, each one comprising half a day, will therefore be:

1. Geopolitics
2. Identity and Values
3. Economics and Business.

This Conference constitutes a unique opportunity for leading decision-makers and scholars to identify, together with future leaders, new pathways of action. It is for this reason that we invite you to share your personal experience and your vision for the future of Europe. Bringing your voice to this year’s Conference will be pivotal in inspiring participants and guiding such critical discussions towards a revitalized role of Europe in the world.
We sincerely hope that you will be able to join the Conference and we will do everything possible to make your participation a unique and rewarding experience. In this sense, we would be delighted to discuss with you the details.
