Join us at **Harvard Kennedy School** in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on **February 9 and 10, 2024**, for a conference that brings together **political leaders, CEOs, world-class experts and practitioners** from across Europe to explore and discuss the challenges facing the continent today. The year 2024 marks the 10th anniversary edition of the Conference, which will aim to share perspectives around The European Dream. 2024: A Continent at the Crossroads. 2024 is indeed a pivotal moment for Europe and the transatlantic relationships. From the European Parliamentary elections to elections at the national level (Austria, Finland, Belgium, Romania) and across the Atlantic, 2024 will be a key moment for democracy and define future European policies around climate change, artificial intelligence, and migration.
