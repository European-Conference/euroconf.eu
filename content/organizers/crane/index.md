Eleanor is a post-doc in quantum physics at MIT where she is also on the board of the MIT European Club, working towards simulating nature. She will be starting a faculty position at King's College London in the summer. She is developing a novel approach to quantum computing which uses quantum bits as well as the fundamental particles of nature: fermions and bosons. She enjoys adventures - whatever the nature, and grew up in a superposition of England and France.
