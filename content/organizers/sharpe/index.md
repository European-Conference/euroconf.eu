Ezra Sharpe is a Henry Fellow situated within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Originally from London, he completed his undergraduate studies at Oxford in 2023, where he developed a strong interest in geopolitics and diplomacy, helping to run Oxford’s first ever diplomatic society. As a Henry Fellow, he is now taking classes in data science, machine learning, and international relations in order to research the transformative power of AI for predictive conflict modelling and international peacebuilding efforts. Away from geopolitics and AI, Ezra is a football and travel enthusiast, making it his mission to visit as many football venues around the world as possible.
