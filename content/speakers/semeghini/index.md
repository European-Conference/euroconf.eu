Giulia Semeghini did her PhD at LENS (European Laboratory for Non-linear Spectroscopy) in Florence under the supervision of Giovanni Modugno, studying the effects of disorder on the transport of quantum particles. She continued to work at LENS as a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Marco Fattori, investigating the formation of a novel quantum phase in ultracold atoms, the so-called quantum droplet. She is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Lukin group, where she studies arrays of individual Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which represent an extremely versatile tool for investigations in the direction of both quantum simulation and quantum information.
