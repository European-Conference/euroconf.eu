Ilva Tare is a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center and was most recently a
broadcaster with EuroNews Group. Since 2022, she has been hosting Balkans Debrief, a popular social
media video interview series produced by the Europe Center. The series is widely shared throughout the
region and beyond.

A household name in her native Albania, she has vast experience in the Western Balkans and a track
record of unbiased reporting and trustworthy analysis. Tare has covered politics, EU integration, human
rights, the judiciary and anti-corruption efforts.

In her wide-ranging interviews, Tare has raised visibility about gender and minorities issues, the effects of
disinformation, and the labor rights of journalists. Promoted to leadership positions in newsrooms early in
her career, she is a longtime and keen promoter of young journalists.

In 2021, Tare received a lifetime award from the Albanian Association of Journalists “for her tenacity in
producing and promoting fair and balanced broadcast journalism, her contributions to the growth of
private Albanian broadcasting and her style of informative anchoring.” She holds a Master of Science in
media and communications from the London School of Economics.
