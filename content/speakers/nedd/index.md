Roianne Nedd is Global Director of Inclusion, Diversity, and Belonging at Oliver Wyman. She is an experienced human resources professional with over 20 years of corporate experience across a range of functions, underpinned by a deep commitment to unlocking the potential of people. She holds dual fellowships in Human Resources (FCIPD) and Chartered Accountancy (FCCA), as well as a master's in Business specializing in human resources and research on intersectional feminism, and a postgraduate certificate in Leadership from the Roffey Park Institute and University of Sussex.

Author of the Trusted Black Girl Books (1 &amp; 2), which are focused on Black women’s experiences in the workplace, as well as the Cracked Cocoon series of self-help books, she was named on the Cranfield Women to Watch List 2022, which highlights women who are ready for non-executive board positions. She is passionate about corporate governance, organizational performance, change and design, and leadership empowerment. A skilled and experienced executive coach and seasoned public speaker, she has successfully guided large organizations to modernize their approaches to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Her superpower is bringing balance between different perspectives, and she is often called upon to be a confidante and sounding board for some of the most senior leaders across a range of industries. She is as confident and comfortable in the boardroom as she is on the “shop floor “and flexes her communication style to connect with the size and seniority of her audiences.
