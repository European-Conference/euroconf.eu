Prof. Tommaso Calarco is considered one of the leading quantum physicists today. At least as important is his role as an instigator and as someone who brings others together. He is one of the founding fathers of the European Quantum Manifesto, which led to the billion-euro EU Quantum Flagship programme. Within the programme, he leads the Quantum Community Network, which brings together theorists and experimental groups as well as science and industry. He was also instrumental in founding “EIN Quantum NRW”, the quantum computing network for science and industry in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).
