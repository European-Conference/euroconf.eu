Kelly Agathos is a Greek-American performer, trainer, and moderator based in Brussels, Belgium. After graduating from the University of Cambridge and University College London, she spent 9 years working in EU affairs (including in the European Commission and the European Parliament). In 2019, Kelly turned her passion for improvisational theatre into her full time job, creating both artistic shows as well as facilitating corporate trainings and company events. Her drive for communicating the European Union in an entertaining and accessible way led to the creation of The Schuman Show. Co-founded in 2021 with investigative journalist Lise Witteman, The Schuman Show is a Late Night-meets-SNL live theatre show which brings EU related political comedy to Brussels and beyond.
