Demetri Tsolakis brings an authentic and truly Greek passion for hospitality to Boston’s dining scene. Demetri is a Greek-American entrepreneur whose career began in his parent’s Greek restaurants in Western Massachusetts. No stranger to hard work, Demetri’s dedication to the art of hospitality was born from the time he was tall enough to see over the counter.

Demetri introduced Committee Ouzeri + Bar to Boston’s burgeoning Seaport district in 2015, leading a city-wide resurgence of Greek dining. After a successful launch at Committee that garnered significant local, regional and national media attention, Demetri expanded his vision and introduced a new Greek concept to the city of Boston. Greco Truly Greek is a fast casual eatery that opened its first location on Newbury street in 2017. Bringing truly Greek cuisine to new heights with a casual and authentic experience, Greco embodies the Greek culture that Demetri grew up with. Greco shares tastes of Greece the one way and only way, the truly Greek way. Since debuting, Greco has expanded to three other locations throughout Boston – at Pier 4 in the Seaport District, downtown at Milk Street and at the recently launched Hub Hall food hall in the West End.

In early 2020, Demetri introduced Krasi Meze + Wine to Boston’s historical Back Bay. With Krasi, Demetri developed a concept that takes guests on a culinary adventure where they can experience Greece, differently. Krasi captures the Greek tradition of philoxenia, which is the art of making a stranger a friend. The menu of regional Greek meze sets the stage to feast like gods and goddesses and takes guests on tour throughout Greece, exploring lesser known regions. Krasi proudly boasts the largest all Greek wine list in the country. Krasi has been featured in local, regional and national and international publications such as USA Today, Forbes, Wine Enthusiast, Conde Nast Traveler, Vinepair, Haute Living, Thrillist, Boston Globe, Boston.com, Boston Herald, Boston magazine, Time Out Boston, Eater Boston, Boston Common magazine and more.
