Alberto Alemanno is the Jean Monnet Professor of European Union Law &amp; Policy at HEC Paris.

Alberto’s research has been centered on how the law may be used to improve people’s lives, in particular through the adoption of power-shifting reforms countering social, health, economic, and political disparities of access within society. He’s the author of more than sixty scientific articles and a dozen books. His first trade book – ‘Lobbying for Change: Find Your Voice to Create a Better Society’ – provides a timely analysis and guide to levelling the democratic playing field by empowering ordinary citizens to speak up and inform policy decisions at local, national and international level. 

Originally from Italy, Alberto is a graduate of Harvard Law School, the College of Europe and holds a PhD in International Law &amp; Economics from Bocconi University.

Due to his commitment to bridge the gap between academic research and policy action, Alberto regularly provides advice to NGOs, governments, foundations as well as progressive companies. He has pioneered innovative forms of academic and policy engagement originally via the EU Public Interest Clinic he established with NYU School of Law and his civic start up The Good Lobby*.* The Good Lobby’s mission is to equalize access to power by strengthening the advocacy capacity of civil society and making corporate political influence more accountable and sustainable.

Alberto has been involved in dozens of campaigns, ranging from the first European Citizen Initiative putting an end to international roaming to the adoption of plain packaging of tobacco products across EU countries, from the drafting of the EU whistleblower directive to a decade-old campaign for EU transnational lists and – following the publication of The Guardian’s Op-Ed ‘There are 17 million mobile EU citizens. We deserve a political voice’ – launched ‘Voters without Borders’ asking for full political rights for EU citizens regardless of where they live across the continent.

In the aftermath of the Russian invasion, Alberto designed the Ukraine Corporate Index to nudge companies reassessing their market presence on the Russian market. As recognized by the Financial Times and Forbes, this index played a major role in increasing pressure on businesses to position themselves in relation to the invasion.
