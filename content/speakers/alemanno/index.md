Alberto Alemanno is the Jean Monnet Professor of European Union Law at HEC Paris and permanent visiting professor at the College of Europe in Bruges. One of the leading voices on Europe’s democratization, Alberto’s research has been centered on how the law may be used to improve people’s lives, in particular through the adoption of power-shifting reforms countering social, health, economic, and political disparities of access within society. Alberto is also permanent visiting professor at the University of Tokyo School of Public Policy as well as scholar at The Rutgers Institute for Corporate Social Innovation at Rutgers University.

Due to his commitment to bridge the gap between academic research and policy action, Alberto has established The Good Lobby, a nonprofit whose mission is to equalize access to power. It does so by strengthening the advocacy capacity of civil society and making corporate political influence more accountable and sustainable. Alberto has been involved in dozens of campaigns, ranging from the first European Citizen Initiative putting an end to international roaming to the drafting of the EU whistleblower directive, a decade-old campaign for EU transnational lists and the recently launched ‘Voters without Borders’ asking for full political rights for EU citizens regardless of where they live across the continent. His first trade book, ‘Lobbying for Change: Find Your Voice to Create a Better Society’, provides a conceptual and do-it-yourself guide enabling ordinary citizens to speak up and inform policy decisions at local, national and international level.

The World Economic Forum nominated him Young Global Leader in 2015, was elected Ashoka fellow in 2019, and Social Innovator of the Year by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship in 2022. Alberto is a regular contributor to _Le Monde_, The Guardian, Bloomberg, Politico Europe, and _Domani_, and his scholarly and public interest work has been featured in The Economist, The New York Times, the Financial Times, as well Science and Nature.

Originally from Italy, Alberto is a graduate of Harvard Law School, the College of Europe and holds a PhD in International Law &amp; Economics from Bocconi University. He lives in Bilbao with his three daughters.
