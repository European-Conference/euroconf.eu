## About Us

The European Conference is one of the most important events about Europe and the transatlantic relationships in the United States. It is jointly organized by students from the Harvard Kennedy School, the Harvard Law School, the Harvard Business School, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard School of Public Health. Its core goal is to strengthen the transatlantic dialogue by bringing together leading scholars, policymakers, leaders, and students from both sides of the Atlantic. It also constitutes a unique opportunity for leading decision-makers and scholars to identify, together with future leaders, new pathways of action.
